# 👋 Hi, I'm Shahzaib Sajjad  
**Software Engineer | Java & Laravel Specialist | Backend & Microservices Enthusiast**

I'm a passionate Software Engineering student at **Mohammad Ali Jinnah University (MAJU)**, expected to graduate in 2026. I thrive on building scalable, secure, and efficient backend systems using modern tech stacks. With experience in both Java/Spring Boot and Laravel ecosystems, I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean code, microservices, and cloud-native applications.

🔭 **Currently working at:** Voxtron (Pvt) Ltd as a Software Engineer (promoted after an exceptional internship).  
🌱 **Currently learning:** Advanced Microservices patterns, Event-Driven Architecture, and DevOps practices.  
💬 **Ask me about:** Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, Laravel, REST APIs, and system design.
